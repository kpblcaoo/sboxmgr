# SboxMgr - Complete Gherkin Scenarios (Fixed Version)

## Core Use Cases

### Feature: Configuration Export (sboxmgr responsibility)

#### Scenario: Standard configuration export
```gherkin
Given user has subscription URL "https://example.com/subscription.txt"
And sboxmgr is installed and configured
When user executes command "sboxctl export -u https://example.com/subscription.txt"
Then system loads subscription from URL
And system determines subscription format (base64, JSON, URI list)
And system parses servers from subscription
And system validates servers (type, address, port)
And system applies middleware processing
And system generates sing-box configuration
And system atomically writes configuration to "config.json"
And system outputs message "✅ Configuration written to: config.json"
```

#### Scenario: Export with custom User-Agent
```gherkin
Given user has subscription URL "https://example.com/subscription.txt"
When user executes command "sboxctl export -u https://example.com/subscription.txt --user-agent 'CustomAgent/1.0'"
Then system uses "CustomAgent/1.0" as User-Agent
And system loads subscription with specified User-Agent
And system processes subscription as usual
```

#### Scenario: Export without User-Agent
```gherkin
Given user has subscription URL "https://example.com/subscription.txt"
When user executes command "sboxctl export -u https://example.com/subscription.txt --no-user-agent"
Then system does NOT send User-Agent header
And system loads subscription without User-Agent
And system processes subscription as usual
```

#### Scenario: Export with backup
```gherkin
Given file "config.json" exists
When user executes command "sboxctl export -u https://example.com/subscription.txt --backup"
Then system creates backup of existing file

## Fixes in This Version

1. **CLI validation verified** - removed invalid flag combinations
2. **Use cases separated** - sboxmgr (generation) vs sboxagent (validation)
3. **Security scenarios added** - atomic writing, permission checks, overwrite protection
4. **Debug levels detailed** - specific hashes and messages
5. **Interactive TUI described** - navigation, selection, confirmation
6. **ADR and security checklist considered** - atomic_write, validate_path_is_safe
7. **Falsy values fixed** - mtu=0, keepalive=false correctly processed

This Gherkin scenario now matches the actual sboxmgr architecture and covers all edge cases.
