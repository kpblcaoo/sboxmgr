# Security

This document outlines the security model, threats, and mitigations for SBoxMgr.

## Security Overview

SBoxMgr is designed with security as a core principle. The application handles sensitive configuration data and network traffic, making security critical for safe operation.

## Security Model

### Core Security Principles

1. **Fail-Safe Design**: Errors in one component don't compromise the entire system
2. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
3. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components have minimal required permissions
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
5. **Secure by Default**: Safe configurations are the default

### Threat Categories

#### Network Security
- **Connection Security**: All network requests use HTTPS with proper certificate validation
- **Timeout Protection**: All network operations have configurable timeouts
- **Input Validation**: URLs and network parameters are strictly validated

#### Configuration Security
- **Path Validation**: File paths are validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Content Validation**: Configuration files are validated against schemas
- **Access Control**: Sensitive files have appropriate permissions

#### Data Security
- **No Sensitive Data Logging**: Passwords and tokens are never logged
- **Memory Security**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
- **Secure Storage**: Configuration files are stored with appropriate permissions

## Security Features

### Input Validation

All inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks:

```bash
# URL validation
sboxctl export -u "https://example.com/subscription"

# File path validation
sboxctl export --output "/safe/path/config.json"

# Configuration validation
sboxctl config validate config.json
```

### Error Handling

Errors are handled securely without exposing sensitive information:

```bash
# Debug mode shows technical details (use carefully)
sboxctl export -u "https://example.com/subscription" -d 2

# Normal mode shows user-friendly messages
sboxctl export -u "https://example.com/subscription"
```

### Plugin Security

Plugins run in a controlled environment:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Plugins cannot access system resources
- **Input Validation**: Plugin inputs are validated
- **Resource Limits**: Plugins have memory and time limits
- **Audit Trail**: Plugin actions are logged

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Software Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Validate Configurations**: Use `sboxctl config validate` before applying
3. **Use HTTPS**: Only use HTTPS URLs for subscriptions
4. **Check File Permissions**: Ensure configuration files have appropriate permissions
5. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check logs for unusual activity

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully without exposing sensitive data
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits for external operations
4. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events without sensitive data
5. **Testing**: Include security tests in your test suite

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configure security-related environment variables:

```bash
# Debug level (0=minimal, 1=info, 2=debug)
export SBOXMGR_DEBUG=0

# SSL verification
export SBOXMGR_SSL_VERIFY=true

# Request timeout
export SBOXMGR_TIMEOUT=30

# Log file path
export SBOXMGR_LOG_FILE="/var/log/sboxmgr.log"
```

### Configuration Validation

Validate configurations before use:

```bash
# Validate configuration file
sboxctl config validate config.json

# Check configuration syntax
sboxctl config dump config.json

# Validate profile
sboxctl profile validate profile.json
```

## Security Monitoring

### Log Analysis

Monitor logs for security events:

```bash
# Check for errors
grep ERROR /var/log/sboxmgr.log

# Check for authentication failures
grep "401\|403" /var/log/sboxmgr.log

# Check for unusual activity
grep "WARNING" /var/log/sboxmgr.log
```

### Configuration Auditing

Regularly audit configurations:

```bash
# Validate all configurations
find /etc/sboxmgr -name "*.json" -exec sboxctl config validate {} \;

# Check file permissions
find /etc/sboxmgr -name "*.json" -exec ls -la {} \;
```

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Stop the Service**: Immediately stop SBoxMgr
2. **Preserve Evidence**: Don't delete logs or configuration files
3. **Analyze Logs**: Review logs for suspicious activity
4. **Update Credentials**: Change any exposed credentials
5. **Report**: Report the incident to maintainers

### Reporting Security Issues

To report security issues:

1. **Private Report**: Use GitHub Security Advisories
2. **Include Details**: Provide detailed information about the issue
3. **Proof of Concept**: Include steps to reproduce if possible
4. **Impact Assessment**: Describe the potential impact

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment

- [ ] All configurations validated
- [ ] File permissions set correctly
- [ ] HTTPS URLs used for subscriptions
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] Log files configured and monitored
- [ ] Timeouts configured appropriately

### Regular Maintenance

- [ ] Software updated to latest version
- [ ] Configurations audited
- [ ] Logs reviewed for anomalies
- [ ] Credentials rotated if needed
- [ ] Security tests run

## Compliance

### Data Protection

- **No Personal Data**: SBoxMgr doesn't collect or store personal data
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data is sent to external services

### Privacy

- **Minimal Logging**: Only necessary information is logged
- **No Tracking**: No user tracking or analytics
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally
