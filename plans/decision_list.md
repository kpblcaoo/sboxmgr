# Decision List: Refactoring & Atomization Plan for update-singbox

## 1. Building the Atomization Map
- Use struct.json and module indices to analyze functions, relationships, duplication, and group by areas of responsibility.
- Group functions by meaning (exclusions, selection, state, utils, etc.), build a directory tree based on real relationships.

## 2. Proposed Directory Structure and Modules
```
src/
  main.py (ex-update_singbox.py, only CLI)
  install/
    wizard.py (ex-install_wizard.py)
    venv.py (working with virtual environment)
    systemd.py (working with systemd)
  singbox/
    config/
      fetch.py
      generate.py
      protocol.py
      template.py (if needed)
    server/
      management.py (or split into exclusions.py, selection.py, state.py)
    service/
      manage.py
    utils/
      file.py
      id.py
      temp.py
  logging/
    setup.py
  modules/ (keep as alias for backward compatibility, or remove)
tests/
docs/
```
- Each submodule is a separate area of responsibility, easily testable and extensible.
- Common functions (e.g., handle_temp_file, generate_server_id) go into utils/.
- CLI is only the entry point, all business logic is in modules.

## 4. How to Use Index for Automation
- Automatically find utils function candidates (by docstring, callgraph, repetition).
- Group functions by areas of responsibility (e.g., all functions working with exclusions into one module).
- Build a dependency map to minimize coupling between modules.
- Generate documentation and test coverage map.
- Control regressions by function and module hashes.

---

## 5. Process Instructions
- Each major refactoring step requires updating struct.json and the module index (`llmstruct parse ...`).
- Stop and ask the user to update the index after each significant change in structure or functions.
- Only proceed to the next step after updating the index.
- This approach ensures that the entire process can be done step by step, with user involvement at key control points.
