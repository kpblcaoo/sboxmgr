"""Subscription middleware package for Phase 3 architecture.

Middleware components process subscription data between pipeline stages,
providing transformation, filtering, enrichment, logging, and other
cross-cutting concerns. Each middleware implements the enhanced
`BaseMiddleware` interface with profile integration.

Phase 3 enhancements:
- Profile-aware processing
- Enhanced context support
- Metadata collection
- Error handling strategies
- Conditional execution
- Chain coordination
